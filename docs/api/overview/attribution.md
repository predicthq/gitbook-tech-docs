# Attribution

If your plan requires attribution (check your plan details in the WebApp) you will need to include the text `Events by PredictHQ` wherever you display our data. You can also include a hyperlink to [predicthq.com](https://www.predicthq.com/).

The attribution text should be clearly visible to users and be placed close to the data. Ideally, it should be visible to the user at the same time as the data itself. If this is not practical, e.g. in a mobile app with limited space, it may be placed in a "Settings" or "About" page.
