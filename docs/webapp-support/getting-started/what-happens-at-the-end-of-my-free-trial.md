# What Happens at the End of My Free Trial?

At the end of your 14-day trial, your access to PredictHQ's API will be ended. You can upgrade to a paid plan at any time during or after your 14-day trial to get API access.

If you are interested in a paid please [contact us](https://www.predicthq.com/contact).

While weâ€™d love everyone to continue their PredictHQ journey after their free trial ends, we realize it might not be for everyone. If desired, you can [delete your account](../account-management/how-do-i-delete-my-account.md).
