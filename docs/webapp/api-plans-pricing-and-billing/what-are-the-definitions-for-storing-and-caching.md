# What Are the Definitions for "Storing" and "Caching"?

"**Storing**" refers to any time a copy of PredictHQ Data (e.g. responses to API requests) is retained for later use.

"**Storing**" is only allowed with a paid plan.

"**Caching**" refers to a specific kind of Storing where responses to PredictHQ API requests are retained for the specific purpose of avoiding repeating an identical PredictHQ API request in the future. If the retained data is used for any other purpose, at any time, it can not be considered Caching. If Caching is permitted on your plan, responses may only be cached for 24 hours to avoid the cached data becoming stale - after that a fresh request to the PredictHQ API must be made.
