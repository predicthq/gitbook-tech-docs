# Dynamic Pricing

From missing out on increased revenue to losing operational efficiency and even customers due to poor customer experiences, many `accommodation`, `parking`, `travel`, and `retail` vendors and service providers are painfully aware of demand fluctuations. Most companies won’t realize a demand surge is taking place until 30-50% of availability or stock has been snapped up.

Our customers from these industries often use PredictHQ data to fuel their sales forecasts, dynamic pricing, and business operations in advance. We have created guides for our most common use cases. We’ll start with using PredictHQ data for dynamic pricing examples by industry:

Consider a scenario where a city is scheduled to host a major sports championship and a large music concert in the same week. Or maybe there is a cluster of small events all happening on the same weekend that in aggregate are going to bring in a lot of people into the same part of the city. You might observe a dramatic increase in demand for transportation and parking services, potentially doubling or even tripling compared to normal levels.

To capitalize on surges like this effectively, adopting dynamic pricing strategies becomes crucial.

In the retail industry, failing to recognize demand fluctuations can lead to missed revenue opportunities and operational challenges, much like in the transportation and parking sectors. Imagine a major retail chain facing significant events like Black Friday, Christmas, or even local festivals. Sales could spike dramatically, increasing by 50% to 100% above normal levels during these periods.

Dynamic pricing is a pivotal strategy in harnessing these surges effectively.\
