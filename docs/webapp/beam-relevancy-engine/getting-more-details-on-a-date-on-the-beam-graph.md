# Getting More Details on a Date on the Beam Graph

If you click on a point on the graph it will bring up details for that date:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (63).png" alt="" width="375"><figcaption><p>Details card for a specific day in the Beam Graph</p></figcaption></figure>

This shows you the Actual Demand, Baseline Demand, Remainder and Predicted Attendance as well as relevant events and their category on a given day.

Above the graph there are filters related to the series, that you can switch off and on accordingly. In the **Filters** link you can filter by event category and ranks.

Note that by switching a filter off, that series is removed from the graph, and hovering over the graph will not show information about that series.

Once satisfied with the selected filters, scroll down the page to see a detailed description of the information displayed by the graph.
