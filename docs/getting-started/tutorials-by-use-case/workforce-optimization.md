Companies are increasingly leveraging automated scheduling systems that incorporate demand forecasting to optimize their workforce optimization. These systems use AI and data analysis to predict staffing needs based on factors like seasonal demand, historical sales, and real-time data, enabling businesses to adjust their staffing levels dynamically. Using PredictHQ’s events data allows our customers to optimize this automation.

A retail chains use PredictHQ’s event data to identify local and national events such as `conferences,` `sports events,` and `festivals`. For instance, if a major concert is scheduled near one of their flagship locations, the store anticipates an influx of visitors in the area.

Based on historical sales data during similar past events, a store can adjust its labor forecasting models to predict increased customer traffic. This information helps the store decide how many extra staff members are needed to handle additional customers effectively.

2\. Location type: `radius-based`\
3\. Minimum PHQ rank: 30

A restaurant located in an urban center with frequent local events can use PredictHQ to track upcoming events such as local `festivals,` `conferences`, `concerts`, `parades`, or `public holidays`.

Anticipating more customers, a restaurant can schedule more kitchen and waitstaff for the event period. They also prepare for higher demand in specific menu items that are popular during such events, ensuring they have sufficient supplies and staff to deliver a high-quality dining experience without delay.

By using PredictHQ’s event data in their demand forecasting models, or planning dashboards and calendars, restaurants can more accurately schedule the right amount of labor needed to handle changes in customer volume efficiently. This not only optimizes workforce costs but also enhances customer satisfaction by better-managing peak times.\
