This dataset can be used used in the following ways:

1. Run it as part of the PredictHQ Forecasts API for your own evaluation of the product. You can follow [this guide](forecasts-api-guides/) to get set up and running with our Forecasts API
2. Embed it in your own forecasting solution for evaluation purposes. Your solution might vary, so PredictHQ does not supply any specific third-party forecasting guides, but a good starting point may be found [here](../tutorials-by-use-case/automated-demand-forecasting-with-ml-models.md).
