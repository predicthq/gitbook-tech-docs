# Using the Beam Graph

### Zooming in and out <a href="#zooming-in-and-out" id="zooming-in-and-out"></a>

In the Beam graph, you can zoom in on results and navigate the graph. When you place your pointer (mouse) over the graph you see the toolbar as shown below:

Using the toolbar icons:

* The first icon with the + in the middle of a broken square allows you to select a range and zoom in on it
* The 4 arrows pointing out - allow you to pan the graph - drag left and right
* The plus and minus icons - allow you to zoom in and out
* The 4 diagonal arrows - allow you to reset zoom (if you zoom in this goes back to the default zoom)
