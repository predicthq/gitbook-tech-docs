Whether you are looking after health and pharmaceutical products, food and beverage supply chains, retail store inventory, or other areas, using events can help you more accurately predict and manage inventory.

For example, we’ve seen a drop in demand of up to 50% from the baseline observed at pizza stores in New Jersey when the New Jersey Devils play about 2 mi away. This could be due to the event drawing potential customers from the store, reducing in-store purchases. Another example is in London for a restaurant chain we saw a 25% increase in demand when two major sports events, with a combined attendance of 50,638, were occurring near the store.

In PredictHQ’s system in 2023 for the United States there were 49,574 festivals, 76,498 conferences, and 1,195 instances of public holidays and observances. The cumulative impact of these events on businesses is huge.

Festivals attract large numbers of attendees who often purchase goods like bottled water, energy drinks, sunscreen, and ready-to-eat foods to use during the event. Local stores nearby may see a spike in sales. Conferences bring professionals and tourists to specific cities, leading to increased demand for quick meals, bottled beverages, and personal care products among other items. Holidays typically lead to an increase in demand for specific CPG categories, such as beverages, snacks, and festive decorations.&#x20;

By using events to help predict demand, you can significantly increase the accuracy of your predictions and ensure you account for the fluctuations in demand driven by events.
