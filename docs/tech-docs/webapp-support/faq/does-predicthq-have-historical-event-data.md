# Does PredictHQ Have Historical Event Data?

Yep, we sure do.

It does vary though, how far back our events go. This is because PredictHQ aggregates events from a large number of different sources. Therefore, how far events date back varies between categories and locations.

As a general guide:

* Politics goes all the way back to 2000.
* Concerts, sports, expos, public holidays, observances, performing arts, community, disasters, severe weather and daylight savings goes back to around 2011.
* Terror goes back to around 2012.
* Festivals and school holidays go back to around 2013.
* Conferences and airport delays go back to around 2014.&#x20;

How far back and how far forward you can search and return events depends on your [event visibility](what-does-event-visibility-window-mean.md). You have access to 90 days of historical data on our [14-day Trial](https://signup.predicthq.com/). If you are on a paid plan, the amount of historical data you have access to depends on your contract.
