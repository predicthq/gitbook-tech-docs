# Aviation Rank

Aviation Rank was a numeric value on a logarithmic scale between 0 and 100 to represent the size of the potential impact on air travel by considering both domestic and international travel.

Aviation Rank is deprecated and no longer supported by PredictHQ. Instead, we recommend using [Beam](https://www.predicthq.com/beam) to analyze which events impact you based on your demand. This is a more accurate way to determine the impact of events on individual businesses.\
