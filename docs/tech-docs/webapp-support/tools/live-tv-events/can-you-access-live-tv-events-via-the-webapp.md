**Yes. Live TV Events are available via API (our Broadcast API) and the WebApp.**

### How to use Live TV Events in the WebApp <a href="#how-to-use-live-tv-events-in-control-center" id="how-to-use-live-tv-events-in-control-center"></a>

To search for Live TV Events in the WebApp, follow these steps:&#x20;

1. Log in to the [WebApp](https://control.predicthq.com)
2. Go to "**Search Events**" on the left hand tool bar
3. Select "Live TV Events" on the top of the search (the other option is "real-world events" which you would use for non televised events.) Set parameters for your search. Select the location, date range, timezone, etc. We only cover one category for Live TV Events for now, so you will only be searching within the "sports" category.
4. Televised sports games broadcast information is more accurate the closer to the date of the actual event, so although we recommend selecting a wide enough date range to get meaningful results for our real-world events, we recommend starting with 14-days forward looking data with Live TV Events. In this example we've chosen to look at the next 14 days (we performed the search on April 1st, 2025). You'll see an NBA game is scheduled for April 11th, 2025 between the Houston Rockets and the Los Angeles Lakers that is expected to have a viewership of 245,316.
