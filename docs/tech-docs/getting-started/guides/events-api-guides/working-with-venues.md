# Working with Venues Notebook

Where events have a venue our events are linked to the venues they occur at. For example a sports stadium, a conference center or a concert hall. Venues are stored in our system as [entities](../../predicthq-data/entities.md). Venues are used with our [attended events](../../predicthq-data/event-categories/attendance-based-events.md). Once you know the venue id you can call the [Events API](https://app.gitbook.com/s/kEFs8urDbSJqBmXUI3Lv/events) and retrieve all events at a venue.

Venues are often a key source of demand. If you have a major conference venue or sports center near your business's location you may see a lot of demand from events at that venue.

This notebook is a guide to exploring PredictHQâ€™s venue information. The notebook shows how to:

* Get venue information from the event data
* Display all venues on a map
* See what types of events are more frequently held in venues
* Find the estimated capacity of venues

You can [find the notebook on Github](https://github.com/predicthq/phq-data-science-docs/blob/master/venues/venues-example.ipynb).
