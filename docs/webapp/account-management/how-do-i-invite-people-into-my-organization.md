# How Do I Invite People Into My Organization?

1. Log in to the [WebApp](https://control.predicthq.com/)
2. Choose **Members** from the settings menu in the top right of the WebApp (or go straight to the [Members](https://control.predicthq.com/settings/members) page)
3. Enter the person's email address. Their first and last names are optional
4. Choose the role of "**Admin**" or "**User**".  See the [#members](managing-your-account-settings.md#members "mention") section to learn more about these roles
5. Add additional invites by clicking Add Another Member.
6. When you're ready to send the invites, click **Send Invite**

If the person you're inviting doesn't already have a PredictHQ account, and as long as the person isn't already part of your Organization, the invite will appear under the Pending Invitations list below. Once they accept your invitation, they will be added to your Organization. If they already have a PredictHQ account set up, they will immediately be added to your Organization.

You can also bulk invite other people into your Organization. Instead of adding individual email addresses and filling out their names, simply:

1. Click **Send Bulk Invites**
2. Paste email addresses separated by a comma, space or line break
3. Click **Send Bulk Invites**
