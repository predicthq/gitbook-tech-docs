# API Changes

The PredictHQ API may change from time to time. Major changes that break backwards compatibility will be introduced with a new version but backwards compatible changes may be introduced at any time without warning.

## Backwards Compatible Changes

Examples of some changes we might make that don't break backwards compatibility and may be introduced at any time without warning:

* New fields added to API responses
* New event categories and labels
* New API query parameters
* New API endpoints
