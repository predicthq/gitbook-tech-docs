# Industry-Tuned Predictions

PredictHQ applies large-scale data and advanced machine learning to learn how real-world events affect businesses like yours. When you specify an industry, we apply industry-specific patterns and thresholds - such as how events influence demand over time and the catchment radius that makes sense for your sector.

This makes your results more accurate and relevant out of the box. Beam then further personalizes results with your own demand data.
