# API Tools

### API Tokens

This part of the WebApp allows you to create an API token in order to use the API. See [how-to-create-an-api-token.md](how-to-create-an-api-token.md "mention").

### API Explorer

Clicking on [API Explorer](https://control.predicthq.com/explorer/events) in the left navigation menu will allow you to explore the capabilities of the API and generate code.

_Note: Using an API Access token is optional since you're already logged in._

Now choose the parameters you want to search, filter, or sort by in order to find the events that impact you. Click on view code to generate code to copy and paste to get a POC up and running quickly.

Click on "**Run Request**" to run your API query and see the results.
