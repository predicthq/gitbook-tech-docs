# I Signed Up Using My Google/LinkedIn Account, but I Want To Log In With My Own Email

If you initially signed up for PredictHQ using either your Google or LinkedIn account, you won’t have set a password. Therefore, if you’d like to log into PredictHQ using an email address instead, you’ll need to set up an email address and password combination.

To do this, follow these steps:

1. Go to the [Login](https://auth.predicthq.com/login) page
2. Click **Forgot your password?**
3. Enter your email address
4. Click Send Password Reset Email
5. Check your inbox for a Password Reset email
6. Click the link in the email to set yourself a password

You'll now be able to log in with an email and password combination (as well as the Google or LinkedIn account you initially signed up with).
