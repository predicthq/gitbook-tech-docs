Festivals draw large crowds, boosting sales of products like bottled water, energy drinks, sunscreen, and ready-to-eat foods at local stores. Conferences attract professionals and tourists, increasing demand for quick meals, bottled beverages, and personal care products, among other items. Holidays typically spike demand for specific consumer goods like beverages, snacks, and festive decorations.

**Example in Practice**

Whether you are looking after health and pharmaceutical products, food and beverage supply chains, retail store inventory, or other sectors, event data can enhance inventory prediction and management.

For example, pizza stores in New Jersey see a 50% drop in demand when the New Jersey Devils play about 2 miles away, likely due to these events drawing away potential customers, reducing in-store purchases. Similarly, a restaurant chain in London experienced a 25% increase in demand when two major sports events were taking place nearby and attracted a combined attendance of over 50,000. These instances demonstrate how event data can inform strategic inventory decisions.
