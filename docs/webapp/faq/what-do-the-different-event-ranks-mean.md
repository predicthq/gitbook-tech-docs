# What Do The Different Event Ranks Mean?

Rank is a log scale numerical value between 0 and 100 when using the API. In the WebApp, it is broken down by minor to major, to give you a quick visual indication of potential impact.

PredictHQ currently offers 2 types of rank as follows:

* [PHQ Rank](https://www.predicthq.com/tools/rankings/phq-rank)™ - Represents the potential impact of an event independent of its geographical location.
* [Local Rank](https://www.predicthq.com/tools/rankings/local-rank)™ - Represents the potential impact of an event on its local geographical area.

In the [WebApp](https://control.predicthq.com/) you can use the [API Explorer](../webapp-overview/api-tools.md#api-explorer) to look at the rank parameters and how to use them to filter and sort events data. You can also use the search functionality in the WebApp to. See also our [Events API](../../api/events/search-events.md#query-parameters) reference for information on how to filter and sort on rank in your API calls.&#x20;
