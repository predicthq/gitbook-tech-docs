We have taken the utmost care in capturing school holiday dates but cannot guarantee the accuracy or completeness of this data. Most countries don't release school holiday dates that far into the future, so these will be updated as we source relevant information for each country.

Where a school holiday date is uncertain, an 'estimated' label will be added to the event.

School holiday dates should always only be used as a guideline for the area captured as dates can vary from region to region, school to school and even between school levels - especially in the case of United States.&#x20;
