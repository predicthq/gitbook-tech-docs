# Aviation Rank

Aviation Rank is a numeric value on a logarithmic scale between 0 and 100 to represent the size of the potential impact on air travel by considering both domestic and international travel.

* This rank is calculated by considering several factors such as the eventâ€™s season, geo-location, day of week , event type and more.
* Events with higher Aviation Rank are expected to bring more air travel passengers than events with lower Aviation Rank.
* Aviation Rank is comparable across attended events in terms of the impact on air travel.
* It is a PredictHQ industry-customized rank.
* Events that are unlikely to cause an impact on airline bookings have Aviation Rank of 0.
* If events are not applicable for Aviation Rank, or do not have the required metadata to reliably calculate, the field returns `null`. For example, a terror attack, a local night market, etc.
