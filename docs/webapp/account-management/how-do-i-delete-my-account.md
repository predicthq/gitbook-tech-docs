# How Do I Delete My Account?

{% hint style="warning" %}
#### If you belong to multiple organizations, you will have to remove yourself from each organization individually first before you can fully delete your account.
{% endhint %}

To delete your account, follow these steps:

1. Log into the [WebApp](https://control.predicthq.com/) (or go straight to [Profile](https://control.predicthq.com/settings/profile))
2. Choose Settings and profile
3. Scroll to the bottom of the profile form
4. Choose "Remove me from ..."

Please note that once an account is deleted, you will also be unsubscribed from all our emails and any items created within that account will be lost. API access will be removed. All your information will be wiped. Sorry, we cannot restore your account if you change your mind later.
