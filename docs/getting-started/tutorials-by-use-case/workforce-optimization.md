# Workforce Optimization

Until PredictHQ, labor optimization aligned with event-based demand prediction was impossible to perform effectively or at scale.

Companies are increasingly leveraging automated scheduling systems that incorporate demand forecasting to optimize their workforce optimization. These systems use AI and data analysis to predict staffing needs based on factors like seasonal demand, historical sales, and real-time data, enabling businesses to adjust their staffing levels dynamically. Using PredictHQ’s events data allows businesses to optimize this automation.

<summary>Restaurants</summary>

To implement PredictHQ data to inform workforce optimization for your restaurant business, review the options below:

* **No code:** Use Control Center, the PredictHQ web application, to unlock demand data weeks and months in advance to inform your inventory updates. [Read more](https://www.predicthq.com/support/see-total-daily-event-impact-in-control-center) about Event Trends.
* **Business Intelligence (BI) tools:** Integrate PredictHQ data with your Power BI and Tableau (or other analytics tool) inventory management workflows. See the [Power BI Tutorial ](../guides/tutorials/using-event-data-in-power-bi.md)and [Tableau Tutorial](../guides/tutorials/using-event-data-in-tableau.md).
* **Machine learning models:** Automatically and dynamically update your inventory management by integrating PredictHQ data directly into your demand forecasting models. [Read tutorial. ](../guides/tutorials/improving-demand-forecasting-models-with-event-features.md)
* **Build a custom demand calendar:** See an example of how to implement a calendar heatmap view showing busy days. [Read tutorial](../guides/tutorials/displaying-events-in-a-heatmap-calendar.md).

**Getting Started**

1. Quick [filters](../guides/industry-specific-event-filters.md) for restaurants:
   1. Relevant Event Categories: `public holidays`, `performing-arts`, `conferences`, `concerts`, `festivals`
   2. Location Type: `Center Point & Radius`
   3. Minimum PHQ Rank: 30

**Example in Practice**

A restaurant in an urban center with frequent local events can use PredictHQ to track upcoming events such as local festivals, conferences, concerts, parades, or public holidays.

Anticipating more customers, the restaurant can strategically schedule additional kitchen and waitstaff for these busy periods. They can also prepare for higher demand in specific menu items that are popular during such events, ensuring they have enough supplies and staff to provide a high-quality dining experience without delays.

By incorporating PredictHQ’s event data into their demand forecasting models, or using it in planning dashboards and calendars, restaurants can more accurately determine the necessary labor to efficiently handle fluctuations in customer volume. This approach not only optimizes workforce costs but also enhances customer satisfaction by better managing peak times.

To implement PredictHQ data to inform workforce optimization for your retail business, review the options below:

* **No code:** Use Control Center, the PredictHQ web application, to unlock demand data weeks and months in advance to inform your inventory updates. [Read more](https://www.predicthq.com/support/see-total-daily-event-impact-in-control-center) about Event Trends.

See the [Power BI Tutorial ](../guides/tutorials/using-event-data-in-power-bi.md)and [Tableau Tutorial](../guides/tutorials/using-event-data-in-tableau.md).
* **Load event data to your warehouse:** Take PredictHQ API data and load it into a data warehouse. [Read tutorial](../guides/tutorials/loading-event-data-into-a-data-warehouse.md).
* **Machine learning models:** Automatically and dynamically update your inventory management by integrating PredictHQ data directly into your demand forecasting models. [Read tutorial.](../guides/tutorials/improving-demand-forecasting-models-with-event-features.md)
* **Build a custom demand calendar:** See an example of how to implement a calendar heatmap view showing busy days. [Read tutorial](../guides/tutorials/displaying-events-in-a-heatmap-calendar.md).

**Getting Started**

1. Quick [filters](../guides/industry-specific-event-filters.md) for retail:
   1. Relevant Event Categories: `public holidays`, `performing-arts`, `community`, `conferences`, `festivals`
   2. Location Type: `Center Point & Radius`
   3. Minimum PHQ Rank: 50

**Example in Practice**

Retail chains use PredictHQ’s event data to identify local and national events such as conferences, sports events, and festivals. For example, when a major concert is scheduled near a flagship location, stores anticipate an influx of visitors to the area.

Based on historical sales data during similar past events, stores can adjust their labor forecasting models to predict increased customer traffic. This information helps stores determine the number of additional staff members required to efficiently manage the surge in customers.
