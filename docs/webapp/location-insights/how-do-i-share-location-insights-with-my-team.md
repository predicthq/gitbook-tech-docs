# How Do I Share Location Insights With My Team?

To share the location insights page for any of your saved locations, simply view the location you want to share, and then click Share on the upper right side of the page. Youâ€™ll have the option to copy the link or share it via Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, or email.

Sharing produces a public share page that can be viewed by anyone. The link produced by the share option can be shared with users within or outside your company. Users do not need to log in in order to view the page produced.
