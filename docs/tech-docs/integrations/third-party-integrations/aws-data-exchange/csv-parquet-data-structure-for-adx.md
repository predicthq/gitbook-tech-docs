# CSV/Parquet Data Structure for ADX

<table data-full-width="true"><thead><tr><th width="387.744140625">Field</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>EVENT_ID</code></td><td>The unique identifier of the event.</td></tr><tr><td><code>CREATE_DT</code></td><td>The date and time the event was first seen by PredictHQ in UTC. Also called <code>first_seen</code> in the Events API.</td></tr><tr><td><code>UPDATE_DT</code></td><td>The date and time the event was last updated in UTC.</td></tr><tr><td><code>TITLE</code></td><td>The title of the event.</td></tr><tr><td><code>CATEGORY</code></td><td>The category of the event.</td></tr><tr><td><code>LABELS</code></td><td>The labels associated with the event. The <code>LABELS</code> field is representing PredictHQ's legacy labels, and it's suggested to use the <code>PHQ_LABELS</code> field instead where possible.<br><br>See also our <a href="../../../getting-started/predicthq-data/labels.md">Labels</a> docs.</td></tr><tr><td><code>DESCRIPTION</code></td><td>The description of the event.</td></tr><tr><td><code>EVENT_START</code></td><td><p>The date and time the event starts, recorded in UTC. If the <code>TIMEZONE</code> field is null, the time represents the same relative time across all timezones.</p><p>Additionally, if an event has a start time of midnight in its local timezone, this may indicate that the actual time is unknown. You may wish to omit the time when displaying such events.</p></td></tr><tr><td><code>EVENT_END</code></td><td>The date and time the event ends, recorded in UTC. If the <code>TIMEZONE</code> field is null, the time represents the same relative time across all timezones.</td></tr><tr><td><code>PREDICTED_END</code></td><td>The date and time PredictHQ predicts the event will end, recorded in UTC. If the <code>TIMEZONE</code> field is null, the time represents the same relative time across all timezones. This value is present where an actual <code>EVENT_END</code> is unknown.</td></tr><tr><td><code>TIMEZONE</code></td><td>The time zone of the event in TZ Database format. This is helpful so you know which time zone to convert the dates to (if needed). If the time zone is <code>null</code>, the start and end date should be regarded as time zone agnostic and already being in local time.</td></tr><tr><td><code>ENTITIES</code></td><td>An array of entities linked to the event. This is a complex data type, please see <a href="../../../api/events/search-events.md">Events API</a> for details.</td></tr><tr><td><code>GEO</code></td><td>The geographic details (location) of the event in GeoJSON format.<br><br>See <a href="../../../getting-started/guides/geolocation-guides/">geolocation guides</a> for more information on handling <code>GEO</code> data.</td></tr><tr><td><code>IMPACT_PATTERNS</code></td><td>Also known as “Predicted Impact Patterns”. This field shows impact for leading days (days before the event), lagging days (days after an event) and the days the event occurs. It contains details such as the industry vertical the impact pattern applies to, the type of impact shown in the impact pattern, and an array of objects for each day showing the date in the local timezone of the event and the value of the impact_type for that given day.<br><br>See also our <a href="../../../getting-started/predicthq-data/impact-patterns.md">Impact Patterns</a> docs.</td></tr><tr><td><code>SCOPE</code></td><td><p>The geographical scope the events apply to. Possible values are:</p><ul><li><code>locality</code></li><li><code>localadmin</code></li><li><code>county</code></li><li><code>region</code></li><li><code>country</code></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><code>PLACEKEY</code></td><td>The Placekey identifier for the physical address where the event takes place. See <a href="../../../getting-started/guides/geolocation-guides/searching-by-location/find-events-by-placekey.md">Placekey</a>. This field will be <code>null</code> if the "What" part or the "Where" part of the Placekey for the event address couldn't be retrieved.</td></tr><tr><td><code>COUNTRY_CODE</code></td><td>The country code in ISO 3166-1 alpha 2 format. This value is typically present, but in some cases such as events occurring outside any country (e.g. an earthquake in the middle of the ocean), it may be empty.</td></tr><tr><td><code>PLACE_HIERARCHIES</code></td><td><p>An array of place hierarchies for the event. Each hierarchy is an array of place ids. The final place in a hierarchy is a specific place the event applies to. Each place is a sub-place of the place immediately preceding it in the hierarchy. An empty array is possible and valid.</p><p>See also the <a href="../../../getting-started/guides/geolocation-guides/understanding-place-hierarchies.md">Place Hierarchies guide</a>.</p></td></tr><tr><td><code>PHQ_ATTENDANCE</code></td><td><p>A numerical value that reflects the predicted attendance for supported attendance-based categories. Supported categories include concerts, performing arts, sports, expos, conferences, community, and festivals. Some academic and school holiday events may also include a phq_attendance value to indicate student numbers.</p><p>For multi-day events, phq_attendance represents total attendance across the entire duration, except for certain categories like conferences, where it reflects daily attendance.</p><p>For details see our <a href="../../../getting-started/predicthq-data/predicted-attendance.md">Predicted Attendance guide</a>.</p></td></tr><tr><td><code>PHQ_RANK</code></td><td><p>A log scale numerical value between 0 and 100 with a five-level hierarchical impact schema. It is designed to represent the potential impact of an event independent of its geographical location.</p><p>See also our <a href="../../../getting-started/predicthq-data/ranks/phq-rank.md">PHQ Rank docs</a>.</p></td></tr><tr><td><code>LOCAL_RANK</code></td><td><p>Similar to PHQ Rank, this is a log scale numerical value between 0 and 100 with a five-level hierarchical impact schema. It is designed to represent the potential impact of an event on its local geographical area.</p><p>Local Rank is calculated for events in the categories community, concerts, conferences, expos, sports, festivals, performing-arts. If local_rank is not intended to be available for an event, this field will be <code>null</code>.</p><p>See also our <a href="../../../getting-started/predicthq-data/ranks/local-rank.md">Local Rank docs</a>.</p></td></tr><tr><td><code>AVIATION_RANK</code></td><td><p>A log scale numerical value between 0 and 100 with a five-level hierarchical impact schema. Aviation Rank indicates how much an event will impact flight bookings by considering both domestic and international travel.</p><p>Aviation Rank is no longer actively supported. For more information, see the <a href="../../../getting-started/predicthq-data/ranks/aviation-rank.md">Aviation Rank docs</a>.</p></td></tr><tr><td><code>STATUS</code></td><td><p>The publication state of the event.</p><p>Possible values:</p><ul><li><code>active</code> - The event is an active event.</li><li><code>postponed</code> - The event is a postponed event, and is expected to occur at a later date.</li><li><code>cancelled</code> - The event is a cancelled event and is not expected to occur at a later date.</li><li><code>predicted</code> - The event is a predicted event.

Examples of brand-unsafe events include content that promotes hate, violence, or discrimination, coarse language, content that is sexually suggestive or explicit, etc.</td></tr><tr><td><code>PARENT_EVENT_ID</code></td><td>Used to indicate if this event is part of a larger event. These types of events are called umbrella events in the system. For example, a large multi-day parent umbrella event may have individual child events for sessions on different days. This field only shows if a child event has a parent id. It does not indicate if a parent event has child events. For details see our <a href="../../../getting-started/guides/date-and-time-guides/working-with-multi-day-and-umbrella-events.md">Umbrella Events docs</a>.</td></tr><tr><td><code>CANCELLED_DT</code></td><td>The date and time the event was marked as cancelled, presented in the UTC timezone.
