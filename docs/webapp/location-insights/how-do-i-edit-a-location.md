# How Do I Edit a Location?

To edit a location, go to the Location Insights page and find the location you want to edit under All Location Insights. Under the Actions column, there are 4 icons. Click on the last icon, which is a series of 3 dots. This will open a menu with the option to edit this location. Here, you can adjust any of the settings for this location including its name, tags, location, and radius.

You can also edit a location from its own individual location page.
