# How Do I Integrate Live TV Events into Forecasting Models?

PredictHQ’s Live TV Events feature enables our customers to identify how many people will watch a TV broadcast at a given location. You would use our Broadcast API to query the number of people watching a game in a given location.

We provide historic data from Jan 1, 2018 and predicted viewership for two weeks from the current date. Customers can use this to model how Live TV Events have impacted their business in the past to inform accurate forecasts based on our future-looking TV viewership data.

The Broadcasts API provides Live TV Events data by returning broadcast records. A broadcast record represents how many people will watch a physical event broadcasted on a television network, at a specific date, time and location.

You would call the API in the same way that you would call our events data API. Please visit our [technical documentation](../../../api/broadcasts/search-broadcasts.md) for more details.
