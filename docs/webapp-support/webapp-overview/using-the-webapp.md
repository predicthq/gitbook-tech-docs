# Using the WebApp

With the WebApp you can discover and manage the API, and all of the demand intelligence data your business needs in a single place. You can find the WebApp at [control.predicthq.com.](https://control.predicthq.com/)

See below for a video on getting started with the WebApp and the PredictHQ platform.

### Navigation

#### The Sidebar

The sidebar gives you access to all the functionalities within the WebApp, which includes:

1. Saved Locations
2. Search Events
3. Event Trends
4. Beam
5. API Tools
6. Documentation

The sidebar is fully expanded by default. You can choose to toggle the arrow in the top right of the sidebar to collapse by default and only expand the sidebar when you are hovering over it. You can toggle it again to keep it fully expanded and visible.

### Saved Locations

See [an-overview-of-location-insights.md](../location-insights/an-overview-of-location-insights.md "mention").

### Search Events

See [events-search.md](events-search.md "mention").

### Event Trends

The **Event Trends** tab in the WebApp gives you access to a graph view of predicted attendance and predicted event spend at a location to allow you to easily identify trends and demand fluctuations. Use the tabs at the top of the page to toggle between viewing Predicted Attendance or Predicted Event Spend, then filter by location, rank, and date range to view the total impact of all events by day for the selected time period.

### The Dashboard

When you log in to the WebApp, you are taken to the dashboard. The dashboard shows a list of tiles that are shortcuts to common operations (like search). It also includes your top five [Location Insights](../location-insights/) locations. These are the locations with the highest [predicted attendance](../location-insights/what-do-each-of-the-columns-mean.md).

2. Settings
3. Help
4. Profile

#### Plans

The colored tag in the top right will show the name of your current plan and you can then click on it to view more details about your plan. On the plans page, you can see all of the features you have access to on your plan including event visibility, category access and add-ons.
