# Search and View Event Impact in Location Insights

### How Location Insights Integrates Other WebApp Features

When viewing All Location Insights, the locations listed will include icons that link to an advanced search for that specific location and to see the daily event impact for a location. Hover over the icons under actions to see what each does. See the screenshot below:

The location insights pages for each saved location also contain links to search.

### Perform an Advanced Search <a href="#perform-an-advanced-search" id="perform-an-advanced-search"></a>

Click on the search icon from the locations list to search for a location in the WebApp. This is a powerful search feature that lets you refine your search to look at details of what's happening around your location.

When you click on search from location insights:

* It automatically populates the "within" field with the latitude and longitude and radius
* You can now use all the power of search to filter down to specific categories, labels, ranks, and, so on. By default, you see all categories with location insights. But using search, you may want to filter down to look at specific categories like sports only for example, or any combination of categories.
* By default, location insights looks at events within the next 90 days. With search, you can change this to look for events in a shorter time period such as 7 or 14 days, a longer time period, or a historical time period.
* You can also look at the map view or calendar view in the WebApp to further filter and refine what is shown on the map and calendar.

See the article on [using-the-webapp.md](../webapp-overview/using-the-webapp.md "mention") for more details.

### View Event Trends <a href="#view-event-trends" id="view-event-trends"></a>

In the All Location Insights list, select one of your saved locations and click on its View Event Impact icon to see the event trends for that location. The daily event impact shows the total amount of people attending events per day at the specified location. When you choose View Event Impact for a **Center Point & Radius** location, the "within" field will be populated with the latitude, longitude, and radius of the location.

Event trends shows you what's happening at your location in the next 90 days by default, but you can change this by changing the date range. The dotted line on the graph shows the average attendance. In this graph, you can easily see any days with demand surges and any days with below-average demand.

Below the graph, there is a table with more details. Click on the rows in this table to view more information about days with surges, and decreases in demand.
