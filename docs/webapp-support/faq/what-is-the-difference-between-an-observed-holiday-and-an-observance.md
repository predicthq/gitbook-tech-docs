# What Is the Difference Between an Observed Holiday and an Observance?

An Observed Holiday is when a public federal holiday is celebrated on a date that is not the actual event's anniversary date. It is different from an observance in notable ways that we explore in the post below. If tracking either is important for your business,  PredictHQ tracks all public holidays, observances, school holidays and academic holidays globally so you don’t need to worry about tracking them manually. [Find out more here](https://www.predicthq.com/intelligence/data-enrichment/event-categories).

To understand this difference between an observed holiday and an observance, here are two examples of observed holidays. If July 4th (Independence Day) falls on a Saturday, it is "observed" on the Friday before as a holiday (and is usually a day off work). When a federal holiday falls on a weekend, the holiday is usually observed the Friday before or the Monday after. Below is a list of the federal holidays:

* **New Years Day**
  * this holiday is celebrated on the anniversary date, January 1
* **Martin Luther King Jr. Birthday**
  * this is observed on the third Monday of January
* **Presidents Day**
  * this is observed on the third Monday of each February&#x20;
* **Memorial Day**
  * this is observed on the last Monday of May
* **Independence Day**
  * this holiday is celebrated on the anniversary date, July 4
* **Labor Day**
  * this is observed on the first Monday of each September&#x20;
* **Indigenous Peoples’ Day**
  * this holiday is celebrated on the second Monday of each October&#x20;
* **Veterans Day**
  * this holiday is celebrated on the anniversary date, November 11
* **Thanksgiving Day**
  * this holiday is celebrated on the fourth Thursday of each November
* **Christmas Day**
  * this holiday is celebrated on the anniversary date, December 25

Observances, on the other hand, are remembrance, awareness and celebration days or events that are not normally days off work, like Valentine's Day, Mother's Day or Father's Day.
