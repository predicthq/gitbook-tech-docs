# Find Events by Place ID

For this example, we want to find all the sports events that happened in Nottingham, England in March of 2018.

First letâ€™s find the Nottingham Place ID by making a request to the Places endpoint:

```python
import requests

response = requests.get(
    url="https://api.predicthq.com/v1/places/",
    headers={
      "Authorization": "Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN",
      "Accept": "application/json"
    },
    params={
        "q": "Nottingham,England"
    }
)

print(response.json())
```

The first result in the response (shown below) is the correct location we want:

```json
{
    "id": "2641170",
    "type": "locality",
    "name": "Nottingham",
    "county": "Nottingham",
    "region": "England",
    "country": "United Kingdom",
    "country_alpha2": "GB",
    "country_alpha3": "GBR",
    "location": [
        -1.15047,
        52.9536
    ]
}
```

Now we take the Place ID for Nottingham returned above and use it to search for Events happening in that location.

```python
import requests

response = requests.get(
    url="https://api.predicthq.com/v1/events/",
    headers={
      "Authorization": "Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN",
      "Accept": "application/json"
    },
    params={
        "place.scope" : "2641170",  # Nottingham Place ID
        "active.gte" : "2018-03-01",
        "active.lte" : "2018-03-31",
        "category" : "sports",
        "sort" : "rank"
    }
)

print(response.json())
```

A snippet of the results are shown below:

```json
{
  "count": 19,
  "results": [
    {
      "id": "KWjlX366rrrb",
      "title": "Championship - Nottingham Forest vs Derby County",
      "category": "sports",
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

We use Geonames data for our Places, so the id _2641170_ is also a Geoname ID for the same location. Please see the [official Geonames site](http://www.geonames.org/) for more information.

Using `place.scope` will return events that apply to the parent and children places of the specified place (e.g. holidays and other events that apply to a country or region). Alternatively you can use `place.exact` to return events that apply to the specified place only.
