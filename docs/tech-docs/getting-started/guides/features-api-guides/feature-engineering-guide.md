## ML Features in Snowflake

See the [Snowflake Data Science Guide](../../../integrations/third-party-integrations/snowflake/snowflake-data-science-guide/) for details on how to create ML features in Snowflake. Follow this guide on how to get ML features from Snowflake tables as an alternative to calling the Features API directly.
