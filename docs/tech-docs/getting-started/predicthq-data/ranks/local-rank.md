# Local Rank

Local Rank is a numeric value on a logarithmic scale between 0 and 100 to represent the impact of an event to its local area. Local Rank may vary even though the PHQ Rank of the events are the same. For example, a conference with 1,000 people in attendance (with PHQ Rank 50) has a [Local Rank of 43 in Hong Kong](https://events.predicthq.com/events/KKtBoCYP3gWPvgGhnp) where the local population density is around 64,000, while a [Local Rank of 65 in Dublin, Ireland](https://events.predicthq.com/events/0lrweBnDZKrr) where the local population density is around 5,000.

* Local Rank is comparable between the attended events in terms of the eventâ€™s impact to its local area.
* Local Rank is not available for area events, the field returns `null`.
