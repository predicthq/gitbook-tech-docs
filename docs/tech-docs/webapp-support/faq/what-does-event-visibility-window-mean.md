# What Does Event Visibility Window Mean?

Event visibility window refers to how many days into the past and future you can look up events when doing an event search via PredictHQ's API or the WebApp.

Your plan's event visibility only affects your events search i.e. the date range you want to look up events either in the API or through the WebApp using search.

It does **not** affect:

* The ability to view an event details page that is outside of your event visibility window.&#x20;
* Your project and task due dates.
* Your custom event alert dates.
* Your custom reminder dates.

For the free trial, your event visibility is by default 30 days future event visibility and 90 days worth of historical data. If you need this to be widened, please [contact us](https://www.predicthq.com/contact). We will approve an extension only for special use cases.
