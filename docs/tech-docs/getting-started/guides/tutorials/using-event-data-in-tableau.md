# Using Event Data in Tableau

PredictHQ provides a rich repository of event data that can impact key business operations including demand forecasting and strategic planning. This tutorial demonstrates how to seamlessly integrate PredictHQ with Tableau to create dynamic visualizations, offering insights into how events may influence business trends. Follow along as we explore a quick and easy way to load a static event export as well as advice on connecting directly from data warehouses where PredictHQ data is stored.

## Use Cases

Demand Forecasting, Dynamic Pricing, Workforce Optimization, Demand Analytics, Inventory Management, Event Visibility

## Relevant Industries

Accommodation, Consumer Packaged Goods, Grocery and Supermarkets, Leisure, Travel and Tourism, Marketing and Advertising, Parking, Restaurants, Retail, Transportation and Delivery and Others

## Getting Started

This tutorial requires access to both Tableau and PredictHQ.&#x20;

1. Tableau: The instructions provided are based on [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/discover), but other Tableau products, such as Tableau Desktop, should operate similarly.
2. PredictHQ: To download a static export of PredictHQ data, a [PredictHQ account](https://signup.predicthq.com/) is required.

## Connection with JSON File

Tableau supports [various methods](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/exampleconnections_overview.htm) for connecting to data sources, including local files and data warehouses. This tutorial focuses on connecting to PredictHQ data via a [JSON file](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/examples_json.htm).&#x20;

Connecting via a JSON file in Tableau involves downloading a static snapshot of event data through [bulk exporting from PredictHQ's WebApp](../export-data-via-control-center.md). It is particularly useful for scenarios where real-time data updates are not essential. Ideal for quick testing or one-off analyses, this approach provides an efficient way to get started with event data in Tableau. This is a good way to try PredictHQ's data for the first time and explore how it can be useful in your business.

A JSON file export contains a structured list of events, much like a CSV export, but with better handling of nested data. While Tableau also [supports CSV file connections](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/examples_text.htm), accessing nested data, such as [Impact Patterns](../../predicthq-data/impact-patterns.md), is more challenging. In contrast, Tableau's native support for JSON files simplifies the integration and manipulation of nested information, making it the preferred method for connecting PredictHQ data.

### Export File

**Search Events**

1. Access our WebApp: Log in and navigate to [Search Events](https://control.predicthq.com/search/events).&#x20;
2. Configure Filters: Set relevant filters, such as those for category, date, and location. Once set, click 'Search'.

> **Example Search**
>
> To view all [attendance-based events](../../predicthq-data/event-categories/attendance-based-events.md) in San Francisco scheduled or predicted to take place in May 2024, use the following URL with pre-configured filters:
>
> [https://control.predicthq.com/search/events?category=conferences,expos,concerts,festivals,performing-arts,community,sports\&place.scope=5391959\&active.gte=2024-05-01\&active.lte=2024-05-31\&state=active,predicted\&sort=phq\_attendance,-start](https://control.predicthq.com/search/events?category=conferences,expos,concerts,festivals,performing-arts,community,sports\&place.scope=5391959\&active.gte=2024-05-01\&active.lte=2024-05-31\&state=active,predicted\&sort=phq_attendance,-start\&t=1716862100079)

{% hint style="info" %}
For guidance on finding the most relevant events for your business, see [filtering-and-finding-relevant-events.md](filtering-and-finding-relevant-events.md "mention"). For searches around specific locations or stores, exporting a JSON file from our WebApp [Saved Locations](https://control.predicthq.com/location-insights) is recommended.

### Next steps

There are several ways to expand the functionality and relevance of this dashboard to your specific business needs:

1. Incorporate Business Metrics: Integrate key metrics such as sales figures or units sold to gain a comprehensive view of how events influence business performance. Linking event impacts with sales data can help uncover high-level trends and support data-driven decision-making.
2. Explore Impact Patterns: While this tutorial focuses on the immediate impacts of events, exploring additional impact patterns could yield deeper insights. For example, examining patterns leading up to and after events might reveal extended influences on consumer behavior or operational demands.&#x20;
3. Customize Visualizations: Enhance the dashboard with more complex visualizations like heat maps or geographic visualizations. These can offer spatial insights into where events have the most impact, assisting in regional marketing strategies and resource allocation.
4. Up-to-date Event Data: Ensure the dashboard reflects the most current data by considering connections like Snowflake or Amazon Data Exchange. These methods (see [examples](using-event-data-in-tableau.md#other-connection-methods) below) offer real-time updates which are essential for accommodating the dynamic nature of event data.

## Other Connection Methods

While this tutorial primarily focuses on connecting via a JSON file, other connection methods are available for those needing real-time updates or integration with other data services
