# Using Snowflake to Access PredictHQ Events Data

If you are using Snowflake to manage your data or want to try using Snowflake for a new project PredictHQ allows you to access our demand intelligence data using Snowflake Secure Data Share. Integrating with Snowflake Data Share is a quick and easy way to get access to events data in your environment reducing the effort needed from your technical teams to ingest the data. This is an alternative to calling [PredictHQ's Events API](https://app.gitbook.com/s/kEFs8urDbSJqBmXUI3Lv/events) to pull the data into your data lake.

Snowflake Secure Data Share enables companies to access and share PredictHQ’s data in a controlled and efficient way. Access to a Secure Share of our events means you will experience a familiar and high-performance SQL interface with an up-to-date, clean, and complete set of PredictHQ’s data. This means you can immediately incorporate the data into your models, removing or greatly simplifying the need for ELT/ETL processes to pull event data into your data warehouse. You can check out [Introduction to Secure Data Sharing](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-sharing-intro) page if you're interested to read more on Snowflake's Secure Data Sharing.

See the [Snowflake Secure Data Sharing](https://app.gitbook.com/s/tNhzHETmXsrWeVBndqqJ/integrations/third-party-integrations/snowflake) technical documentation for details on how you can access PredictHQ's data with Snowflake
