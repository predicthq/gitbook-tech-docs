# How Do I View Details for One Location?

When viewing All Location Insights, click on one of your saved locations to see more details. Each of your saved locations has its own dedicated page which shows the data and a list of events at this location. See below for an example page for Union Square in San Francisco.

You can bookmark the location insights page for any of your saved locations in your browser â€“ this way, you can easily come back to it and see what's happening at that location.

These pages include the following information and features:

### Location Details <a href="#location-details" id="location-details"></a>

The page first displays the core information about the location: The location name, address, latitude & longitude, radius (for a **Center Point & Radius** location), creator, and creation time.

### Map View <a href="#map-view" id="map-view"></a>

The map shows all the events that are inside the radius or that overlap with the radius (in the case of polygons). Or in the case of a city, state, country location, it shows events in that area.

The map displays icons for events, and the color of the icon indicates the rank of the event. See [using-the-webapp.md](../webapp-overview/using-the-webapp.md "mention")for more details. For polygon events like severe weather, school holidays, or other polygon events, the polygon will be shown on the map to indicate the area the event is impacting.

You can zoom in and out on the map view. Hover over an event to see its name, and click on an event to see the event card. Clicking on the event card will open the event details page.

The map view will show up to a max of 2000 attended events.

### Insights for the Next 90 Days <a href="#insights-for-the-next-90-days" id="insights-for-the-next-90-days"></a>

This is the same data shown on the All Location Insights list ([see here for details](how-do-i-view-my-saved-locations-as-a-list.md)). That includes Predicted Attendance and the number of Attended, Non-attended, and Unscheduled events.

### List of Events <a href="#list-of-events" id="list-of-events"></a>

The list of events at a location is sorted by PHQ rank in descending order by default, meaning the events with the highest PHQ rank are listed first. You can view more details for an event by clicking on more details. Use the sort field to change the default sort order.

Click on **Advanced Search** to refine the search results for a location and look at specific categories, or filter down based on any other criteria.

### What You Can Do On This Page <a href="#what-you-can-do-on-this-page" id="what-you-can-do-on-this-page"></a>

Here's what the buttons and options for this page do:

* Share - Allows you to share the event with other users without the need for them to log into the WebApp.
* Edit - Allows you to edit the location details (name, radius, address, latitude & longitude, etc)
* Delete - Deletes the location. Please note this cannot be undone.
* View Events button - Scrolls down to the events list at the bottom of the page
* Advanced search - Allows you to do an advanced search on the location in order to narrow down or expand the events you see for the location.

See [search-and-view-event-impact-in-location-insights.md](search-and-view-event-impact-in-location-insights.md "mention") for more details.

Note: if you don't have access to a location under your subscription, you won't see any events on the map or in the list view.
