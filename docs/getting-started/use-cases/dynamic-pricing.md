# Dynamic Pricing

From missing out on increased revenue to losing operational efficiency and even customers due to poor customer experiences, many `accommodation`, `parking`, `travel`, and `retail` vendors and service providers are painfully aware of demand fluctuations. Most companies won’t realize a demand surge is taking place until 30-50% of availability or stock has been snapped up.

Our customers from these industries often use PredictHQ data to fuel their sales forecasts, dynamic pricing, and business operations in advance. We have created guides for our most common use cases. We’ll start with using PredictHQ data for dynamic pricing examples by industry:\

PredictHQ helps its customers master predictability with the smartest and largest event impact data stream, which can drive dynamic pricing planning and operations quickly, efficiently, and at scale.

As an example, accommodation customers find it useful to overlay accommodation room price data with event impact data and use that to help guide pricing adjustments. See the example below in Power BI:

<img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Power BI Dynamic Pricing Example.png" alt="" data-size="original">

In this example, we have added daily room price data into the Power BI dashboard showing the total number of people attending events in the location (in this example the location is San Francisco but typically it would be events within a radius around a hotel). You can do this by following the [Power BI tutorial](../guides/tutorials/connect-and-build-events-data-in-power-bi.md) and adding in your data. Based on this you can look for peak days and surges in demand and adjust pricing accordingly.

In this fictional example on the 24 February where 596,569 people are attending events in the area and this is significantly higher than other days. This represents a demand surge or peak in demand that commonly has an impact of businesses. In this case the hotel owner is then adjusting the pricing on this day from $230 to $310 dollars (this may be done in another app).&#x20;

This is a simple way of overlaying attendance and your business data to highlight when to adjust pricing. A more sophisticated way is to use machine learning models to suggested updated pricing or automatically update your pricing.

[**Quick filters**](https://docs.predicthq.com/getting-started/guides/industry-specific-event-filters#location-type) **to get you started - Parking**\
1\. Event categories most impactful for this industry: `public holidays, community, concerts, expos, performing-arts`\
2\. Location type: `radius-based`\
3\. Minimum PHQ rank: 35

For example, consider a scenario where a city is scheduled to host a major sports championship and a large music concert in the same week. Or maybe there is a cluster of small events all happening on the same weekend that in aggregate are going to bring in a lot of people into the same part of the city. You might observe a dramatic increase in demand for transportation and parking services, potentially doubling or even tripling compared to normal levels.

To capitalize on surges like this effectively, adopting dynamic pricing strategies becomes crucial.

2\. Location type: `radius-based`\
3\. Minimum PHQ rank: 50

In the retail industry, failing to recognize demand fluctuations can lead to missed revenue opportunities and operational challenges, much like in the transportation and parking sectors. Imagine a major retail chain facing significant events like Black Friday, Christmas, or even local festivals. Sales could spike dramatically, increasing by 50% to 100% above normal levels during these periods.

Dynamic pricing is a pivotal strategy in harnessing these surges effectively.
