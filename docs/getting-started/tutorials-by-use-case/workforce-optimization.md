# Workforce Optimization

Until PredictHQ, labor optimization aligned with event-based demand prediction was impossible to perform effectively or at scale.

By using events data you can ensure you roster more staff for busy times or reduce staff numbers when there is less demand. For industries like restaurants and retail, this can make all the difference in terms of whether you have a profitable day. As events are a big driver of demand they can be used to determine your busy days and adjust workforce levels accordingly.

Companies are increasingly leveraging automated scheduling systems that incorporate demand forecasting to optimize their labor management. These systems use AI and data analysis to predict staffing needs based on factors like seasonal demand, historical sales, and real-time data, enabling businesses to adjust their staffing levels dynamically. Using PredictHQ’s events data allows companies to optimize this automation.

<summary>Retail</summary>

A retail store chain can use PredictHQ’s event data to identify local and national events such as concerts, sports events, and festivals. For instance, if a major concert is scheduled near one of their flagship locations, the store anticipates an influx of visitors in the area.

Based on historical sales data during similar past events, a store can adjust its labor forecasting models to predict increased customer traffic. This information helps the store decide how many extra staff members are needed to handle additional customers effectively.

A forecast can then indicate the need for more cashiers, floor staff, and security during the event days. The store schedules additional staff for these days to ensure a smooth shopping experience, manage checkout lines efficiently, and maintain high customer service standards.

By using PredictHQ’s event data in their demand forecasting models, customers can more accurately schedule the right amount of labor needed to handle changes in customer volume efficiently. This not only optimizes labor costs but also enhances customer satisfaction by better-managing peak times.\

<summary>Restaurants</summary>

A restaurant located in an urban center with frequent local events can use PredictHQ to track upcoming events such as local festivals, community events, concerts, parades, or public holidays.

Restaurants analyze data from previous years when similar events occurred. They notice a pattern of significantly higher patronage during these periods. Using this data, they update their demand forecasting models to predict spikes in customer visits.

Anticipating more customers, a restaurant can schedule more kitchen and waitstaff for the event period. They also prepare for higher demand in specific menu items that are popular during such events, ensuring they have sufficient supplies and staff to deliver a high-quality dining experience without delay.

By using PredictHQ’s event data in their demand forecasting models, customers can more accurately schedule the right amount of labor needed to handle changes in customer volume efficiently. This not only optimizes labor costs but also enhances customer satisfaction by better-managing peak times.\
