# Find Broadcasts by County Place ID

For this example we want to find all broadcasts televised in two counties in California during November 2020.

The `location.place_id` parameter allows us to filter live sports events by their broadcast locations. For the counties in our example, we will use `location.place_id=5368381,5391832`, which are the respective Place IDs for Los Angeles County and San Diego County in California.

These Place IDs were found using the [Places API](broken-reference). We provide a CSV file of broadcast counties to download, to make it easier to discover the `place_id` for all counties and states in the US.

{% file src="../../../../api/.gitbook/assets/broadcast-events-place-mapping.csv" %}

We can also use the `start.*` parameters to filter broadcasts by time. For the time range in our example, we will use `start.gte=2020-11-01` and `start.lte=2020-11-30`. Using `start.tz=America/Los_Angeles` will treat the parameterâ€™s start dates and times in the America/Los\_Angeles time zone, otherwise the parameter dates and times will be treated as UTC.

```python
import requests

response = requests.get(
    url="https://api.predicthq.com/v1/broadcasts/",
    headers={
        "Accept": "application/json",
        "Authorization": "Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN"
    },
    params={
        "location.place_id": "5368381,5391832",
        "start.gte": "2020-11-01",
        "start.lte": "2020-11-30",
        "start.tz": "America/Los_Angeles"
    }
)

print(response.json())
```

A snippet of the results are shown below:
