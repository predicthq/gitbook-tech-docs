# Using Power BI and Tableau With PredictHQ Data

### Microsoft Power BI <a href="#microsoft-power-bi" id="microsoft-power-bi"></a>

Microsoft Power BI allows you to create rich, interactive data visualizations from multiple data sources and share important business insights that drive success. You can use [Power BI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-nz/power-platform/products/power-bi/) to create data visualizations around PredictHQ's intelligent events data.

See our tutorial on [Using Event Data in Power BI ](https://app.gitbook.com/s/tNhzHETmXsrWeVBndqqJ/getting-started/guides/tutorials/using-event-data-in-power-bi)for more information.

We support several different methods to integrate with Power BI, the most appropriate method will depend on your team, expertise, and needs. Some popular methods our customers use to visualize data within Power BI include:

* Snowflake - Event data can be provided via Snowflake, more information and example datasets are available in the [guide to using Snowflake with PredictHQ data](https://app.gitbook.com/s/tNhzHETmXsrWeVBndqqJ/integrations/third-party-integrations/snowflake/snowflake-data-science-guide)
* Amazon Data Exchange - Event data can be provided via ADX, more information and example datasets are available in the [guide to using ADX with PredictHQ data](https://app.gitbook.com/s/tNhzHETmXsrWeVBndqqJ/integrations/third-party-integrations/aws-data-exchange)
* CSV or JSON format - Event data can be exported in either format as required - see [our tutorial on using Power BI](https://app.gitbook.com/s/tNhzHETmXsrWeVBndqqJ/getting-started/guides/tutorials/using-event-data-in-power-bi)
