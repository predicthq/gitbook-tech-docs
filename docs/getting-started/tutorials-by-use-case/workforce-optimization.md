# Workforce Optimization

Until PredictHQ, labor optimization aligned with event-based demand prediction was impossible to perform effectively or at scale.

Our customers across the food and beverage, travel, retail, and accommodation industries are driving exceptional customer experiences by ensuring their businesses are ready for any surge.

By using events data you can ensure you roster more staff for busy times or reduce staff numbers when there is less demand. For industries like restaurants, this can make all the difference in terms of having a profitable day. As events are a big driver of demand they can be used to determine your busy days and adjust workforce levels accordingly.
