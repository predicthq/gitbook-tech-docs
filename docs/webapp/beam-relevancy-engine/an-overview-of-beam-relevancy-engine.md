# An Overview of Beam - Relevancy Engine

### What is Beam - Relevancy Engine? <a href="#what-is-beam-relevancy-engine" id="what-is-beam-relevancy-engine"></a>

PredictHQ's relevancy engine (Beam) helps you identify what events have impacted your demand in the past, to help you make better decisions in the future.

Beam is an automated correlation engine that accurately reveals the events that drive demand for your business. Beam converts unstructured, dynamic event data into a workable dataset, allowing data science teams to use intelligent event data in machine learning models. PredictHQ Beam combines and correlates our event data with your transactional demand data. See our [Beam Product Page](https://www.predicthq.com/tools/beam) for more details.

Beam also shows you how events will impact your business in the future. By analyzing your historical data, decomposing it, correlating event data with your unexplained demand, and analyzing the result data it predicts what events will impact your future demand.

Beam is accessible via our WebApp and via the [Beam API](https://app.gitbook.com/s/kEFs8urDbSJqBmXUI3Lv/beam). To use Beam you upload demand data for a location. Beam decomposes your data into a baseline and remainder and shows you the correlation with events data. Beam will also show you the most important categories that are impacting your location. You can also export the decomposed data from Beam.

The Beam UI is good to use if you have a smaller number of analyses or if you are exploring how events impact your demand. Use the [Beam API](https://app.gitbook.com/s/kEFs8urDbSJqBmXUI3Lv/beam) if you want to bulk upload a large number of analyses. Many customers use Beam to analyze which categories impact them the most and then use that information as input to build machine learning features.

Beam is available to all customers with WebApp access. Simply sign up for your free 14-day trial and upload your data to Beam.
