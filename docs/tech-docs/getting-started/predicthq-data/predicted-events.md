# Predicted Events

Predicted Events are events that haven’t been scheduled or even announced yet, but are predicted to occur — based on years of historical event, demand and venue data. This provides a degree of probability for when and where these events will happen to enable you to plan well before anyone else – at scale.

Predicted Events have their own status, and you will be able to search and retrieve them just as any other event. Stay up to date with changes to event status, so if the event is ultimately scheduled – it will move from a `predicted` event, to an `active` event with confirmed event details, including start times and more. If the predicted event is canceled or postponed, the event status will be updated to reflect this. You will be able to see this in both the web UI or via API by setting the state filter to predicted.
