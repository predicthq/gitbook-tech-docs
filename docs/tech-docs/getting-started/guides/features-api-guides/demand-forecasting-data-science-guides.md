# Demand Forecasting with Event Features

See the [notebook on GitHub](https://github.com/predicthq/phq-data-science-docs/blob/master/demand-forecasting-with-events/demand-forecasting-with-event-features.ipynb).

While this notebook uses inputs from the [Beam API](broken-reference) and [Features API](broken-reference), it is self-contained and can be run independently. Check out the following guides for more information:

* [beam-guides](../beam-guides/ "mention")
* [feature-engineering-guide.md](feature-engineering-guide.md "mention")
