# What is Event Trends?

Looking at individual spikes often leads to too small of a data set to accurately correlate events to your transactional demand. By doing it at an aggregate level, a data science team will be looking at enough volume of spike days to prove correlations between demand and events.&#x20;

See [Event Trends in the WebApp](see-event-trends-in-the-webapp.md). See also the [Features API](../../getting-started/guides/features-api-guides/increase-accuracy-with-the-features-api.md) for details about how to get aggregated daily data via the API.

You can also use our [Beam](../beam-relevancy-engine/) tool to find how event impact your demand.
