# Live TV Events Data Science Guides

These guides consist of the following three notebooks:

* [**Part 1: Data Engineering:**](https://github.com/predicthq/phq-data-science-docs/blob/master/live-tv-events/part\_1\_data\_engineering.ipynb) shows you how you could call the Live TV Events Broadcast API to extract data to a DataFrame.
* [**Part 2: Data Exploration**](https://github.com/predicthq/phq-data-science-docs/blob/master/live-tv-events/part\_2\_data\_exploration.ipynb) provides a guide to exploring PredictHQ's Live TV Events data for Data Science teams.
* [**Part 3: Feature Engineering**](https://github.com/predicthq/phq-data-science-docs/blob/master/live-tv-events/part\_3\_feature\_engineering.ipynb) provides examples of how to aggregate and extract features from the data.
